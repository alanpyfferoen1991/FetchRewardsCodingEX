This json object located in the Brands.json file contains an escape charater for "Big G" witch is causing \copy command to fail with error invalid input syntax for type json.
To fix this error I added an addition backslash along side the original. This allowed the copy command for work without fail.
{"_id":{"$oid":"5dc07e2aa60b873d6b0666d1"},"name":"General Mills \"Big G\" Cereal","cpg":{"$ref":"Cogs","$id":{"$oid":"53e10d6368abd3c7065097cc"}},"barcode":"511111006305","brandCode":"GENERAL MILLS CEREAL"}

Users.json contain 70 of the 212 users had duplicate records. This will cause issues because _id is a unique column in the users table.

purchasedItemCount doesn't match the item count in the rewardsReceiptItemList: Need to confirm this.

I setup a Foreign Key Constraint on Reciepts table for the userId referencing the Users table _id.
When I stated inserting the data I got an the following error. insert or update on table "Receipts" violates foreign key constraint "users_fkey"
I decide to remove the constraint and run the following query to check if there where receipts.userId that didn't exist in the users table.
select count(*)
from "Receipts"
where "userId" not in (select _Id
                       from users)
this returned a 148 receipts that didn't have users in the users table.
There are two ways I can fix this
 1. Removed the Receipts that do not have matching userid in the users table.
 2. Create users for those receipts.
 
#Brands Data Issues:
The Brands data that was provided had the following issues
 - 234 records had the BrandCode null this will affect the results of the Report to find the Top 5 Brands by Receipt scanned for most recent month.
 - I found barcode data in BrandCode column
 - I think the BrandCode should be more consistant.
 - I would like to have more information as to how the BrandCode column is populated.
